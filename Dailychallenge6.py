# Create a Python function that accepts a string.
# This function should count the number of Xs and the number of
# Os in the string. It should then return a boolean value of either True or False.
# If the count of Xs and Os are equal,
# then the function should return True. 
# If the count isnâ€™t the same, it should return False. 
# If there are no Xs or Os in the string, 
# it should also return True because 0 equals 0. 
# The string can contain any type and number of characters.
